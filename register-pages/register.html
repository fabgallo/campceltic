<a href="http://campceltic.ca/CampCelticRegistration.pdf">[frame_right]http://www.campceltic.ca/wpimages/register_mainform.gif[/frame_right]</a><strong>It's time to register!</strong> We recommend you first <a href="http://campceltic.ca/CampCelticRegistration.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">download our registration form</span></a>. It has all the information you need regarding Summer Camp, Sports Camp and Leadership Camp including dates and prices.

Campers registering for more than one session and families with three or more campers should contact Celtic for a quote on fees. Campers attending consecutive camp sessions may stay over free of charge between sessions.

Once we receive your registration we will send you a complete list of what campers need to bring with them, times for camp drop-off and pick-up, and a receipt for income tax purposes. Your child’s camp fees may be tax-deductible.

<strong>You have two options for registering your child:</strong>
<h2>Option 1: Register Online</h2>
Our online registration form allows you to quickly and easily register your child for camp. Once you confirm your submission, payment is made securely with a Visa or MasterCard credit card. If you have received a quote on fees, would like to follow a payment plan as indicated below, or use a different payment method, you are required to register by mail.

Please fill out as much of the form as you can. We will require any missing information before your child arrives at Camp Celtic.
